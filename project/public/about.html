        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>This interactive web application explores South Africa's socioeconomic landscape using data from the General Household Survey 2023. It provides insights into living conditions, income distribution, access to services, and more, empowering users to engage with the data and understand the complexities of South African society.</p>

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Broad Representation: The application covers critical themes like food security, income, education, health, and demographics, ensuring diverse and user-customizable insights.</li>
            <li>Scholarly Support: The visualisations are grounded in scholarly research, promoting civic engagement and policy impact by making complex data accessible and understandable (Rosling et al., 2018).</li>
            <li>Dynamic Usage: The application leverages interactive elements like sliders and toggles to allow users to explore data dynamically and uncover meaningful patterns (Chen, 1976).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>This application is designed for the general public, aiming to make complex socioeconomic data accessible and engaging for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Visual Style</h3>
        <p>The interface follows a clean and minimalist aesthetic, prioritizing the visualizations and ensuring a clear and uncluttered presentation. Colour choices are inspired by the South African flag, adding a subtle thematic touch.</p>

        <h3>Visualisations</h3>
        <p>The application incorporates a variety of interactive visualisations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interactive Maps (Choropleth): Display regional disparities in key indicators across South African provinces.</li>
            <li>Bar Charts: Compare categorical data and distributions.</li>
            <li>Line Charts: Track trends over time.</li>
            <li>Bubble Charts: Visualise correlations between three variables.</li>
            <li>Heatmaps: Analyse correlations and distributions for two categorical variables.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
        <p>The application offers a range of interactive features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Map Interaction: Zoom, pan, and hover over provinces to view detailed information.</li>
            <li>Dynamic Filters: Filter data by province, geographic type, income, and other relevant variables.</li>
            <li>Chart Interaction: Access tooltips on charts to reveal precise data values and additional details.</li>
            <li>Data Comparison Tools: Compare data across different provinces or categories.</li>
            <li>Guided Exploration Mode: A step-by-step walkthrough of key visualisations with explanations.</li>
        </ul>
